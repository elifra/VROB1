                            Use-ViSP-CMake
			    Release  1.0.0

         Copyright Projet Lagadic / IRISA-INRIA Rennes, 2007
                  www: http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic



This project is using the CMake build system and shows how to use ViSP
(http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp) as a third party library.

CMake is a complete stand-alone platform-independant build-system 
replacing autotools (autoconf/autoheader/automake/libtools) completely. 
It depends just on installed cmake (tested with version 2.2.x or more recent 
versions). See http://www.cmake.org for details.

USAGE: 
=====

1. Install the newest cmake from www.cmake.org
2. Check out/install Use-ViSP-CMake source code from ViSP web site

--- Unix ---
cd <Use-ViSP-CMake source dir>
ccmake .  

  Set ViSP_DIR variable to the location where ViSP library was
  installed. If you don't have change it while ViSP configuration, VISP_DIR
  has to be set to /usr/local/lib.

make
make html-doc

--- WIN32 --- 
Use CMakeSetup.exe to set environment variables and proceed as
described for Linux.  The GUI is self-explaining.

Project building
================

(1) compile:
> make
> or with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) build project ALL_BUILD

(2) clean:
> make clean
> or with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) build project CLEAN
The "make clean" target will remove files generated by the compiler and linker.

(3) documentation
> make html-doc
> or with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) build project html-doc
Generate doxygen html documentation in doc/html.

(4) install:
> make install
> or with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) build project INSTALL
Copy headers in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/example
Copy library in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib

(5) uninstall:  
> make uninstall
> or with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) build project UNINSTALL
Remove headers in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/example
Remove library in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib
